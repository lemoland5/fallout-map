## Completed

## Current goals
1. Map display screen
    - Map reacts to hover, overall responsiveness (e.g. map regions/icons)
    - Map has the most distinct regions marked
    - Ability to zoom in
        - If applicable, show maps of subregions if prompted
2. Marker system
    - Built-in markers highlighting vital game-specific information (loot, monsters, etc.)
    - Ability to create own, customiseable markers
    - Ability to filter markers
    - Markers carry over to additional displayed maps of subregions
3. Wiki interface
    - Highlighted regions, areas, etc. can be prompted to show information about specific topic from the wiki
    - Ability to search topics by keywords (e.g. show information about the New Vegas Strip from searchbar queries like 'vegas', 'the strip')
